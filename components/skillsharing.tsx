      <p>
        <b>Skill-sharing</b> simply put, is sharing expert skills with another
        party interested in acquiring them. With over 50 years of experience and
        award-winning work, I hope to be able to share my skills with each of
        you. Central Pennsylvania is home to tremendous valleys, mountain ranges
        and fields, and there is so much history and potential in cultivating a
        healthy garden in this region. Iâ€™ll be offering group seminars in the
        coming weeks and currently offer one-on-one training.
